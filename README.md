# Car Rental Management System

- This system is designed for a Car Rental Co. (CRC). The information required includes a description of cars, subcontractors (i.e. garages), company expenditures, company revenues and customers. 
- Cars are to be described by such data as: make, model, year of production, engine size, fuel type, number of passengers, registration number, purchase price, purchase date, rent price and insurance details. 
- Factors which should be taken into account in specifying and designing this system are:
	- It is the company policy not to keep any car for a period exceeding one year.
	- All major repairs and maintenance are done by subcontractors (i.e. franchised garages), with whom CRC has long-term agreements.
	- Some garages require payments immediately after a repair has been made; with others CRC has made arrangements for credit facilities.
	- Company expenditures are to be registered for all outgoings connected with purchases, repairs, maintenance, insurance etc. Similarly the cash inflow coming from all sources - car hire, car sales, insurance claims - must be kept of file.
	- CRC maintains a reasonably stable client base. For this privileged category of customers special credit card facilities are provided.
	- These customers may also book in advance a particular car. These reservations can be made for any period of time up to one month.
	- Casual customers must pay a deposit for an estimated time of rental, unless they wish to pay by credit card. All major credit cards care accepted.
